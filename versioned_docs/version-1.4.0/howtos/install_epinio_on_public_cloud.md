# Install Epinio on Public Clouds

Epinio can be installed on any Kubernetes distribution, including the Public Cloud ones.

## Public Clouds configuration

<details>
<summary>Microsoft AKS configuration</summary>

### AKS prerequisites

* Epinio has been tested with AKS version **v1.21.9**
* To just try out Epinio, e.g. 2 **Standard_D2_v2** nodes are sufficient

### Create an AKS cluster

If you do not have an existing cluster, follow the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough) to create an AKS cluster.

:::caution

In AKS, Epinio must be installed with an external registry because due to a [change](https://github.com/epinio/epinio/issues/1373#issuecomment-1105231113) in Azure, we cannot use internal registry anymore.
