# OIDC authentication

Since version **1.3.0**, Epinio has integrated [Dex](https://dexidp.io/) as an identity provider which adds the support for external OIDC providers.

To authenticate through Dex, you can use the login command with the `--oidc` flag. This will open a web page where you can authenticate with the configured providers.

```bash
epinio login --oidc https://epinio.mydomain.com
```

If you are using the `epinio` cli without a desktop environment you can provide the `--prompt` flag. This will give you the url where you can authenticate, and it will wait for the authorization code that you will get at the end of the authentication.

```bash
epinio login --oidc --prompt https://epinio.172.21.0.4.omg.howdoi.website
```

By default, only the local connector is setup with two users (`admin@epinio.io` and `epinio@epinio.io`).
To add more connectors, you can edit the Dex config file deployed with the `dex-config` secret in the `epinio` namespace.

After a successful login, a new Epinio user will be created with the username matching the email used to login and returned by the provider.


If you want to login with the same email through the Epinio UI, you should set a password for your user by patching the user secret.

Find the secret name:
```
export EPINIO_USERNAME=$(echo -n 'admin@epinio.io' | base64)
kubectl get secret -n epinio -o json -l epinio.io/api-user-credentials | jq -r ".items[] | select(.data.username==\"$EPINIO_USERNAME\") | .metadata.name"

ruser-adminepinioio-9341763ee7dcbce070e7c14f246ec8291e9a7278
```

Patch the secret with the encrypted password:
```
export EPINIO_PASSWORD=$(echo -n '$2a$10$6bCi5NMstMK781In7JGiL.B44pgoplUb330FQvm6mVXMppbXBPiXS' | base64 -w0)
kubectl patch secret -n epinio -p="{\"data\":{\"password\": \"$EPINIO_PASSWORD\"}}" ruser-adminepinioio-9341763ee7dcbce070e7c14f246ec8291e9a7278

secret/ruser-adminepinioio-9341763ee7dcbce070e7c14f246ec8291e9a7278 patched
```

You're now able to login with the credentials in Epinio UI.
