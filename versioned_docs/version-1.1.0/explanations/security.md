## A Quick Note On Security

Epinio secures access to its API with TLS and basic authentication.

Use the `epinio login [URL]` command after installation to save the necessary credentials
(user, password) and certificates. The information is stored in Epinio's settings,
for pickup by other Epinio commands.

For a trial deployment the certificate securing the API will be generated by the
underlying cluster, and self-signed, and its CA certificate is stored in the
settings to allow verification.

For a production-oriented deployment on the other hand, with a proper
domain specified (`--set global.domain=...` when installing the chart),
the certificate can be obtained from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Nothing is stored in the
settings in that case, as Let's Encrypt is a known CA. 

> NOTE: Read more on how to use Let's Encrypt here: [Certificate Issuers](../howtos/certificate_issuers.md).

How Kubernetes accesses the Epinio registry (TLS or not) is handled a bit differently depending on installation flags.
More details here: [Epinio Registry](../explanations/advanced.md#container-registry).
