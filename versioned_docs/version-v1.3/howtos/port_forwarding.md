## How to use Port Forwarding

This how-to demonstrates how to use port forwarding to access a running application.

Port forwarding can be started with the `port-forward` command:

```
epinio app port-forward samplejava 34506:8080
```

This will forward the traffic coming from `localhost:34506` to the remote `:8080`.
__Note__ that specification of the local port is optional. When none is provided a random port will be selected.

### Point to a specific instance

Port forwarding can be directed to a specific instance of your app. To do this list all the instances of the application, pick the desired ID, and then use the `--instance` flag to direct the port forwarding to that instance:

```
-> % epinio app show samplejava
