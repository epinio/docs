# Custom a custom Builder image

The default builder image used by Epinio (paketobuildpacks/builder:full) may not work for every application.
This could happen if a non-supported programming language is used, or when the application needs to be staged in a very specific way.
This page explains how a custom builder image can be built that includes one or more buildpacks.
We don't explain how to create a custom buildpack in this guide ([upstream docs](https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/) or [with packit](https://paketo.io/docs/howto/create-paketo-buildpack/)).

## Background

If you are familiar with the [`pack` cli](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/) you know that
it's possible to add a buildpack to a project using `project.toml`:

```toml
[project]
id = "sample"
version = "0.1"

[build]

[[build.buildpacks]]
id = "paketo-community/python"
version = "0.4.2"
```

Pack can then build the image for the application by running `pack build test/pip -B paketobuildpacks/builder:full`.

However, since Epinio is not using `pack` but the `lifecycle` directly ([link 1](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle), [link 2](https://github.com/epinio/helm-charts/blob/3954c214de3d7b957cfc2054ba4fa4bfa140f5a3/chart/epinio/templates/stage-scripts.yaml#L83)), using project.toml is not possible:

* https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/issues/555
* https://github.com/haliliceylan/rfcs/blob/2152fc5c817d971b6ead2069d82c459f432a7acc/text/0000-prepare-phase.md

## Solution: Using a Custom Builder

We can create a custom builder that supports Python and tell Epinio to use that for staging.

```
git clone git@github.com:paketo-buildpacks/full-builder.git

patch -p1 <<EOF

pack builder create myorg/epicustombuilder --config builder.toml
```

Make the image `epicustombuilder:local` available to your cluster by pushing it to a container registry.
You can then push your application to Epinio and use your image with the `--builder-image` flag:

```
epinio push -n myapp -p app_directory --builder-image myorg/epicustombuilder:latest
```
