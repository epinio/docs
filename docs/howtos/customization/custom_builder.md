The default builder image used by Epinio (paketobuildpacks/builder:full) may not work for every application.
It could happen if using an unsupported programming language,
or when the application needs staging in a particular way.
This page explains how to build a custom builder image including one or more buildpacks.
This guide doesn't explain how to create a custom buildpack.
For information on that,
use the ([Buildpack documentation](https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/)
or the [Paketo documentation](https://paketo.io/docs/howto/create-paketo-buildpack/)).

## Background

Using the [`pack` CLI](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/)
you can add a buildpack to a project using a `project.toml` configuration file:

```toml
[project]
id = "sample"
version = "0.1"

[build]

[[build.buildpacks]]
id = "paketo-community/python"
version = "0.4.2"
```

You can then build the image for the application by running:

```console
pack build test/pip -B paketobuildpacks/builder:full
```

However, since Epinio isn't using `pack` but the `lifecycle` directly
([link 1](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle),
[link 2](https://github.com/epinio/helm-charts/blob/3954c214de3d7b957cfc2054ba4fa4bfa140f5a3/chart/epinio/templates/stage-scripts.yaml#L83)),
using project.toml isn't possible:

* https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/issues/555
* https://github.com/haliliceylan/rfcs/blob/2152fc5c817d971b6ead2069d82c459f432a7acc/text/0000-prepare-phase.md

## Solution: Using a custom builder

You can create a custom builder that supports Python and then tell Epinio to use that for staging.

```console
git clone git@github.com:paketo-buildpacks/full-builder.git

patch -p1 <<EOF
diff --git a/builder.toml b/builder.toml

pack builder create myorg/epicustombuilder --config builder.toml
```

Make the image `epicustombuilder:local` available to your cluster by pushing it to a container registry.
You can then push your application to Epinio and use your image with the `--builder-image` flag:

```console
epinio push -n myapp -p app_directory --builder-image myorg/epicustombuilder:latest
```
