# Contributing to Epinio

Epinio accepts contributions via GitHub issues and pull requests.
This document outlines the process to get your pull request accepted.

## Start With An Issue

Prior to creating a pull request it is a good idea to [create an issue].
This is especially true if the change request is something large.
The bug, feature request, or other type of issue can be discussed prior to
creating the pull request. This can reduce rework.

[Create an issue]: https://github.com/epinio/epinio/issues/new

## Sign Your Commits

A sign-off is a line at the end of the explanation for a commit.
All commits have to be signed. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch
or otherwise have the right to contribute the material. When you sign-off you
agree to the following rules
(from [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/)):

```
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
1 Letterman Drive
Suite D4700
San Francisco, CA, 94129

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

Then you add a line to every git commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@example.com>

Use your real name (no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` in your local git configuration, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`.

:::note

If your git config information is set properly then viewing the `git log`
information for your commit will look something like this:

```
Author: John Smith <john.smith@example.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 2 11:41:15 2018 -0800
    Update README
    Signed-off-by: John Smith <john.smith@example.com>
```
Notice how the `Author` and `Signed-off-by` lines match. If they don't your PR will
be rejected by the automated DCO check.

:::

## Pull Requests

Pull requests for a code change should reference the issue they are related to.
This will enable issues to serve as a central point of reference for a change.
For example, if a pull request fixes or completes an issue, the commit or
pull request should include:

```md
Closes #123
```

In this case "123" is the corresponding issue number.

## Semantic Versioning

Epinio follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

This does not cover other tools included in Epinio.
Kubernetes has its own [release versioning](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/release/versioning.md#kubernetes-release-versioning)
scheme that looks like SemVer but is semantically different.

## Coding Style

Epinio expects its Go code to be formatted with `go fmt`.

Epinio further follows the style guidelines at

  - [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) and
  - [Go Wiki Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
  - [Go Style At Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/guide)
