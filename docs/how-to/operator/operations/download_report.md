Epinio provides a **report** that summarizes your cluster and application scaling. It is similar to Rancher’s node report and is useful for support and understanding usage (e.g. for pricing).

The report includes:

- **Cluster and nodes**: Node list with roles (etcd, control plane, worker), addresses, CPU/RAM capacity, OS, container runtime, creation time
- **System pods**: Epinio system pods with ready status, restarts, age
- **Applications**: Per-application desired instances and **last scale** (when, from/to, by whom), so you can see scaling history and average usage

## Download from the UI

1. In the Epinio dashboard, open **System** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **About**.
3. In the **Download report** section, click **Download Report**.
4. A text report file (e.g. `epinio-report-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss.txt`) is downloaded.

:::note Admin only

Downloading the report requires admin permissions. If you see an authorization error, use an admin account or ask your operator to download the report.
