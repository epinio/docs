The `epinio` CLI can be used to interact with a cluster with Epinio installed.
Requests to the Epinio API server are authenticated with Basic Auth.
No direct access to the cluster is required (e.g. through kubectl).

## Install from Homebrew (Linux and Mac)

Epinio has a formula available in the homebrew/core tap.

```bash
brew install epinio
```

Alternatively, if you want to get the latest Epinio CLI faster, there is a custom tap you can use:

```bash
brew tap epinio/tap
brew install epinio/tap/epinio
```

## Install from the Binary Releases

Find the latest version at [Releases](https://github.com/epinio/epinio/releases).

### Linux

```bash
curl -o epinio -L https://github.com/epinio/epinio/releases/download/v1.10.0/epinio-linux-x86_64
```

### MacOS

```bash
curl -o epinio -L https://github.com/epinio/epinio/releases/download/v1.10.0/epinio-darwin-x86_64
```

### Windows

```bash
 curl -LO https://github.com/epinio/epinio/releases/download/v1.10.0/epinio-windows-x86_64.zip
```

Extract the zip archive then make sure that the `PATH` environment variable references the directory where the `epinio` binary is located.

### Make the Binary Executable (Linux and Mac)

```bash
chmod +x epinio
```

Make sure your `PATH` environment variable contains the directory where you placed the Epinio binary.

## Verify Downloaded Files

This is done using the `cosign` tool.
The following commands were tested using cosign version 2.1.1.

### Verify File Checksum Signature

Instead of signing all release assets, Epinio signs a file containing checksums for the release assets.
From the repository you can download the three files:

- `epinio_1.10.0_checksums.txt.pem`,
- `epinio_1.10.0_checksums.txt.sig`,
- `epinio_1.10.0_checksums.txt`


```
curl -LO https://github.com/epinio/epinio/releases/download/v1.10.0/epinio_1.10.0_checksums.txt.pem
curl -LO https://github.com/epinio/epinio/releases/download/v1.10.0/epinio_1.10.0_checksums.txt.sig
curl -LO https://github.com/epinio/epinio/releases/download/v1.10.0/epinio_1.10.0_checksums.txt
```

Once you have the three files locally, you can execute the following command

```
cosign verify-blob \
	--certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/epinio/epinio" \
	--certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
	--cert      epinio_1.10.0_checksums.txt.pem \
	--signature epinio_1.10.0_checksums.txt.sig \
	epinio_1.10.0_checksums.txt
```

A successful output looks like

```
Verified OK
```

Now you can verify the asset's checksum integrity.

### Verify File Checksum Integrity

Before verifying the file integrity, you should first verify the checksum file signature.
Once youâ€™ve downloaded both the checksums and your binary, you can verify integrity by running:

```
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c epinio_1.10.0_checksums.txt
```

:::note

For this check to work the local `epinio` binary must have the same name as
listed in the checksum file, i.e. `epinio-linux-x86_64`, `epinio-darwin-x86_64`, etc.

For Windows the checksum is for the zip archive, not for the binary inside.

:::

# Verify the Installation

Run `epinio version` to test the successful installation.

```bash
> epinio version
Epinio Version: v1.10.0
Go Version: go1.20
```
