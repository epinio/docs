Epinio can be installed on any Kubernetes distribution,
including those provided by public clouds.

## Public clouds configuration

### Microsoft AKS

#### AKS prerequisites

* Epinio has been tested with AKS version **v1.21.9**
* To try out Epinio, two **Standard_D2_v2** nodes are enough

#### Create an AKS cluster

If you don't have an existing cluster,
follow the
[quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough)
to create an AKS cluster.

:::note

In AKS, Epinio must be installed with an external registry.
Due to a
[change](https://github.com/epinio/epinio/issues/1373#issuecomment-1105231113)
in Azure
using the internal registry is no longer possible.

:::

### Amazon EKS

#### EKS prerequisites

* Epinio has been tested with EKS version **v1.22**, **v1.23** and **v1.24**
* To try out Epinio, two **t3a.large** nodes are enough

#### Create an EKS cluster

If you don't have an existing EKS cluster, follow the [quickstart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to create one.

Details are in the dedicated [EKS documentation](./install_epinio_on_eks.md).

### Google GKE

#### GKE prerequisites

* Epinio has been tested with GKE version **v1.21.9**
* To try out Epinio, one **n2-standard-4** node is enough

#### Create a GKE cluster

If you don't have an existing GKE cluster, follow the [quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart) to create one.

## Install Epinio
