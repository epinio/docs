# Deploy Gitea with a custom builder image

While you likely won't use Epinio to build and deploy Gitea, we are using it to show how to build a more complex application with Epinio.

[Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea) is a self-hosted Git service. It is written in Go and Node.js.

At the time of writing the Paketo Go buildpack doesn't support Node.js asset compilation (see [issue #671](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/go/issues/671)), so we need to create a custom builder.

This builder will just check the needed Go and Node dependencies, and execute the `make` command to build both the frontend and the backend.

The code used during this guide is available in the [example-builder-gitea](https://github.com/epinio/example-builder-gitea) repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/epinio/example-builder-gitea
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd example-builder-gitea
```


## Basic Concepts and prerequisites

Before starting it is useful to know some basic concepts around Buildpacks, and have some tools already installed.

You can find in the Buildpack documentation what [stacks](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/stack/), [builders](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/builder/), and [buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/buildpack/) are. You should also have [`pack`](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/) installed, along with `docker` and `skopeo` (to manage OCI artifacts).


## Create the stack

Unfortunately we were not able to reuse the [Paketo Full Stack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/bionic-full-stack) because of a missing dependency in the `run` image. To make it simpler we just [forked](https://github.com/epinio/bionic-full-stack) this stack and added `git` to the run packages (see [408e949](https://github.com/epinio/bionic-full-stack/commit/408e949558a437c99858ac7bb99a8b78e78935e8)).

> Note:  
> We had to fork and/or reuse the same stack ID in order to reuse some Paketo buildpacks, that are going to work only with these stacks (see https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/node-engine/blob/main/buildpack.toml#L29).

### Build the stack and publish the image

To build the stack:

```
./stacks/bionic-full-stack/scripts/create.sh
```

This will create two OCI images in the `stacks/bionic-full-stack/build` folder:

- build.oci
- run.oci


From this folder we can untar the OCI artifacts

```
cd stacks/bionic-full-stack/build
mkdir build && tar -xf build.oci -C build
mkdir run   && tar -xf run.oci   -C run
```

use `skopeo` to copy the artifacts into our local Docker registry

```
skopeo -v copy oci:build docker-daemon:ghcr.io/enrichman/bionic-full-stack-build:0.1.0
skopeo -v copy oci:run   docker-daemon:ghcr.io/enrichman/bionic-full-stack-run:0.1.0
```

and push them to a public registry

```
docker push ghcr.io/enrichman/bionic-full-stack-build:0.1.0
docker push ghcr.io/enrichman/bionic-full-stack-run:0.1.0
```

## Create the `make` buildpack

To build the Gitea application we created a `make` buildpack.

### `bin/detect`

During the `detect` phase the `bin/detect` script it will check the needed dependencies. 

It will check for the existance of the Makefile

```bash
if [[ ! -f Makefile ]]; then
    echo Makefile not found
    exit 100
fi
```

and it will write to the plan.toml file that this buildpack requires Go and Node.js

```bash
cat >> "${plan_path}" <<EOL
[[requires]]
name = "node"
# version = "*"

[requires.metadata]
build = true

[[requires]]
name = "go"

[requires.metadata]
build = true
EOL
```

### `bin/build`

During the `build` phase the buildpack will run the proper `make` command to build the application

```bash
TAGS="bindata" make build
```

setup the app configuration changing the listening port in the `app.ini` file


```bash
cp custom/conf/app.example.ini custom/conf/app.ini
sed -i "s/;HTTP_PORT = 3000/HTTP_PORT = 8080/" custom/conf/app.ini
```

and defining the launch process in the `launch.toml` file

```bash
cat >> "${layers_dir}/launch.toml" <<EOL
[[processes]]
type = "web"
command = "./gitea"
default = true
EOL
```

## Create and publish the builder

The `builder.toml` file contains the buildpacks references and their execution order/groups.

We are referencing our `make` buildpack locally

```toml
[[buildpacks]]
id = "make"
version = "0.0.1"
uri = "../../buildpacks/make"
```

and we are also using the Paketo `node-engine` and `go-dist` buildpacks

```toml
[[buildpacks]]
uri = "docker://gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/node-engine:1.3.0"
version = "1.3.0"

[[buildpacks]]
uri = "docker://gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/go-dist:2.3.0"
version = "2.3.0"
```

These buildpacks will provide the Node.js and Go dependencies

- https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/node-engine
- https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/go-dist


We can finally create the builder image with `pack`

```
pack builder create ghcr.io/enrichman/gitea-builder:0.1.0 --config builders/gitea-builder/builder.toml
```

and push it to a public registry

```
docker push ghcr.io/enrichman/gitea-builder:0.1.0
```

## Deploy Gitea

To deploy Gitea we can download the code from the reposotory, or refer directly to it.

We would like to deploy a stable release, so let's find the commit of the `v1.19.0` with a couple of curls:

```bash
export GITEA_VERSION=v1.19.0
export GITEA_TAG_OBJECT_URL=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/git/refs/tags/$GITEA_VERSION | jq -r '.object.url')
export GITEA_TAG_COMMIT_SHA=$(curl -s $GITEA_TAG_OBJECT_URL | jq -r '.object.sha')
```

We can now deply Gitea with a simple `epinio push`:


```
epinio push --name gitea \
    --git https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea,$GITEA_TAG_COMMIT_SHA \
    --builder-image ghcr.io/enrichman/gitea-builder:0.1.0
```

and then it should be available on your cluster (i.e. https://gitea.<SYSTEM_DOMAIN>)!

### Create and bind the database

We can go a step further, creating and binding the `mysql` database to our application:

```
epinio service create mysql-dev mydb
```

We can check the status of the service

```
-> % epinio service show mydb

```

We can use the internal route `xcca9aa0f19a036fb6389474a7be0-mysql.workspace.svc.cluster.local:3306` to reach our DB.

Let's bind it to the Gitea application with `epinio service bind mydb gitea`.

And we can now check the username and passwords in the configuration:

We can use these credential to access the database.
Access the first time Gitea configuration from your browser and fill the database fields with the host, username and password. The database name is `my_database`, that is the default value for the Bitnami charts that Epinio is using for its sample services.
