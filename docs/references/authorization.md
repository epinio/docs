# Authorization

Since version **1.11.0** Epinio is shipped with a new authorization layer with two default roles: **admin** and **user**.
Roles can be "namescoped", and they can be also customized with different permissions.

A user with the admin role will have the permission to perform any operation. A standard user will have only read permissions, but also has the permissions to create namespaces. When a user creates a namespace, they will automatically have the admin permission for it.

By default, after the installation two users are available: `admin` and `epinio`, both with the password `password`. The operator can control the creation of those users through the `api.users` key in [values.yaml](https://github.com/epinio/helm-charts/blob/main/chart/epinio/values.yaml).
In a production setup, the default `api.users` value needs to be overridden.

## Switch user

To switch users you need to set the `user` and `pass` keys of the Epinio settings file, located at `~/.config/epinio/settings.yaml`.
The password has to be base64 encoded. Below, `cGFzc3dvcmQ=` is the base64 encoded version of `password`.

You can also login again with the `epinio login [URL]` command.


```yaml
api: https://epinio.mydomain.com
appchart: ""
certs: |

```

## List the Epinio users

An Epinio user is a BasicAuth Kubernetes Secret, with the `epinio.io/api-user-credentials` reserved label.

To list the available users you can get the secrets from your cluster with `kubectl`, filtering them with the proper labels:

```bash
# list all the users
kubectl get secrets -n epinio -l 'epinio.io/api-user-credentials'
NAME                  TYPE        DATA   AGE
default-epinio-user   BasicAuth   3      5m10s
admin-epinio-user     BasicAuth   2      5m10s
```


## Add a new user

Since a user is simply a Kubernetes Secret you can create a new user with a `kubectl apply`:

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: BasicAuth
metadata:
  labels:
    epinio.io/api-user-credentials: "true"
    epinio.io/roles: "admin"
  name: my-epinio-user
  namespace: epinio
stringData:
  username: myuser
  password: "\$2a\$10\$6bCi5NMstMK781In7JGiL.B44pgoplUb330FQvm6mVXMppbXBPiXS"
EOF
```

## Roles

An Epinio role is a Kubernetes ConfigMap, with the `epinio.io/role` reserved label.

The following yaml shows you the default `user` role:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    epinio.io/role: "true"
  name: "epinio-user-role"
  namespace: {{ $.Release.Namespace }}
data:
  id: user
  name: "Epinio User Role"
  default: "true"
  actions: |
    namespace
    app_read
    configuration_read
    service_read
    gitconfig_read
```

### Fields

| Key     | Description 
|---------|-------------
| id      | The ID of the Role
| name    | A friendly name for the Role
| default | (optional) if set to _true_ the role will be the one selected as default if no other roles were assigned to the user
| actions | The actions the roles can perform

## Actions

Each Role can perform some actions defined in the __actions__ field (newline separated). These actions are hardcoded in Epinio, and some of them depend on other actions. Enabling an action with a dependency will automatically enable the dependency as well.

### Namespace

These actions enable operations on Namespace commands and resources.

| Action ID         | Description 
|-------------------|-------------
| `namespace_read`    | Read permissions (list, show)
| `namespace_write`   | Write permissions (create, delete)<br/>Depends on: `namespace_read`
| `namespace`         | All the above<br/>Depends on: `namespace_read`, `namespace_write`

### App

These actions enable operations on App commands and resources. They also enable commands related to  AppCharts (`epinio app chart`) and application environment variables.

| Action ID       | Description 
|-----------------|-------------
| `app_read`        | Read permissions (app list and show, env list and show)
| `app_logs`        | Read application logs
| `app_write`       | Write permissions (app create, delete, push, export, stage, env set and unset)<br/>Depends on: `app_read`, `app_logs`
| `app_exec`        | Perform an exec into a running application
| `app_portforward` | Open a tunnel with the `port-forward` command
| `app`             | All the above<br/>Depends on: `app_read`, `app_logs`, `app_write`, `app_exec`, `app_portforward`

### Configuration

These actions enable operations on Configuration commands and resources. Be aware that to bind a configuration you still need the `app_write` permission as well.


| Action ID           | Description 
|----------------------|-------------
| `configuration_read`  | Read permissions (list, show)
| `configuration_write` | Write permissions (create, delete)<br/>Depends on: `configuration_read`
| `configuration`       | All the above<br/>Depends on: `configuration_read`, `configuration_write`

### Service

These actions enable operations on Service commands and resources. 

| Action ID             | Description 
|-----------------------|-------------
| `service_read`        | Read permissions (list, show)
| `service_write`       | Write permissions (create, delete, bind, unbind)<br/>Depends on: `service_read`
| `service_portforward` | Open a tunnel with the `port-forward` command
| `service`             | All the above<br/>Depends on: `service_read`, `service_write`, `service_portforward`

### Gitconfig

These actions enable operations on Gitconfig commands and resources.

| Action ID         | Description 
|-------------------|-------------
| `gitconfig_read`    | Read permissions (list, show)
| `gitconfig_write`   | Write permissions (create, delete)<br/>Depends on: `gitconfig_read`
| `gitconfig`         | All the above<br/>Depends on: `gitconfig_read`, `gitconfig_write`

### Export Registries

This action enable operations on Export Registries commands and resources. Only read operations are available.

| Action ID                 | Description 
|---------------------------|-------------
| `export_registries_read`  | Read permissions


## Assign Roles to User

The `epinio.io/roles` annotation is used to declare the list of the assigned roles. It's a comma separated string with the ID of the roles.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: BasicAuth
metadata:
  labels:
    epinio.io/api-user-credentials: "true" # indicates this secret represents a user
  annotations:
    epinio.io/roles: "user,admin" # comma-separated list of roles
  name: my-epinio-user
  namespace: epinio
stringData:
  username: myuser
  password: "$2a$10$6bCi5NMstMK781In7JGiL.B44pgoplUb330FQvm6mVXMppbXBPiXS" # password hashed with the Bcrypt algorithm
```

### Define Role Access to a Namespace

Users may be granted access to a particular namespace via two mechanisms:

1. **Role Annotations with Scoping Delimiter `:` (recommended)**
    - The roles assigned via the `epinio.io/roles` annotation on a user object may be namespace-scoped via the `:` delimiter.
        - Format:  `roleName:namespace`
    - For example, a user may be granted administrator privileges to a specific namespace while maintaining non-admin access elsewhere:
        - Specifically, note the `admin:some-namespace` annotation item

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        type: BasicAuth
        metadata:
          labels:
            epinio.io/api-user-credentials: "true"
          annotations:
            epinio.io/roles: "user,admin:some-namespace"
          name: my-epinio-user
          namespace: epinio
        stringData:
          username: myuser
          password: "some-hashed-password"
        ```
    - We recommend this approach as it aligns with the automated flow through OIDC authentication, expanded upon below.

2. **Namespaces Array on User Object**
    - Namespaces can be assigned to a user via an additional `namespaces` key in the user Secret's data
    - These namespaces are represented as an array separated by newlines.

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        type: BasicAuth
        metadata:
          labels:
            epinio.io/api-user-credentials: "true"
            epinio.io/roles: "user,admin"
          name: my-epinio-user
          namespace: epinio
        stringData:
          username: myuser
          password: "some-hashed-password"
          namespaces: |
            workspace
            workspace2
        ```

Additionally, this concept may be automated as part of OIDC authentication via Epinio's reference to a `rolesMapping` key within the `dex-config` secret data.  Please refer to our [documentation on OIDC Authentication](./authentication_oidc.md#groups-and-roles-mapping) for further explanation.  Note that the `roles` array within the `rolesMapping` secret can include the same `:` delimiter described here.
